### Authenticating a User
# User Authentication API

Authenticates a user by verifying their username and password. If the credentials are valid, a JWT token is returned which can be used for subsequent authenticated requests. 

## Request

```http
POST /authenticate
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "username": "user",
    "password": "password"
}
```
> **Note:** The password will be verified against the hashed password stored in the database using the bcrypt library or a similar library.
